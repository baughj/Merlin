List of things I'd like to get done soon (2-4 weeks):

 * Model validators! Remove all the old cruft (there's still a lot)
 * Refactor: api_request (remove xml stuff which is from pre-release cruft)
 * Refactor: Fix pluralization of models/etc where needed, make sure everything
   is Rails-like
 * DNS updates with BIND/etc should work correctly
 * Make sure the following workflow is fully implemented, to start:
   + Create instance using Merlin with associated volume(s)
   + Userdata script works for all cases (hello, attach_storage,
     completed, intervene)
 * Release a real version (and then start using actual migrations)

Things I'd like to do over the course of a few months (2-4 mo):

 * Stop using AM/ActiveMQ and use Redis/Resque
 * Closer puppet integration (Facter/API stuff)
 * Unit tests!
 * Snapshot implementation

Things it would be great if other people could pick up:

 * AJAX/general UI work
