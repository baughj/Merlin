Greetings from the Merlin system.

The <%= @newinst.instance_type %> instance you requested has been 
successfully instantiated by the cloud API.

However, as of this message, the instance does not yet seem to have
completed a provisioning cycle by Puppet.

You can SSH to <%= @newinst.external_ip %> using the API-registered
public key to diagnose what's wrong.
